    // between an Array[Array[Node]] and a NodeMatrixGraphView
    // I think I will make a NodeMatrix class, and make GraphFactory return it.
    // There is one thing to check before I do: is it okay that we use `Position`s to index the grid?
    // GraphFactory seems to avoid it, but Iâ€™m not sure whether that is because
    // they thought it would be confusing to convert scaled positions to unscaled positions,
    // or because a Position is only supposed to represent something specific to the game map, and should not be generic.
    // Look at the places Position is used in the code to see if it is ever used differently,
    // or if there are any comments saying not to.
